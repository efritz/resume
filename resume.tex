  {2015 - Now}
  {Milwaukee, WI}
  {
    Developed \emph{Summit} and the surrounding infrastructure for ShoreTel's communications platform as a service. The platform allows users to build voice and SMS applications with Lua code that runs in containerized sandboxes. My primary contributions include solutions for container scheduling, rate and process limiting applied per-client, cross-datacenter storage, voice recognition, and real-time audio mixing and streaming.

  {2008 - 2011}
  {Janesville, WI }
  {
    Developed an e-commerce and supply chain web application which streamline interactions between jewelry consumers, retailers, and suppliers. My primary contributions include a consumer-facing jewelry collection showcase and a retail (brick-and-mortar) location management system. Primary tehcnologies include ASP.NET MVC using C\# and MSSQL.

\section{education}

\entry
  {PhD Computer Science}
  {University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee}
  {2014 - 2018}
  {Milwaukee, WI}
  {
    \emph{`Waddle: Always-Canonical Intermediate Representation'}: an optimizing compiler and a supporting set of algorithms whose internal representation never \emph{goes stale}. Local updates to internal structures reduces compilation time while yielding the same output.
  }

\entry
  {MS Computer Science}
  {University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee}
  {2011 - 2013}
  {Milwaukee, WI}
  {
    \emph{`Optimizing the RedPrairie Distance Cache'}: implemented and evaluated a number of caching solutions for RedPrairie's vehicular route solver using production query data given hard runtime and space constraints. Applying the chosen caching strategy provided a marked improvement in the solver's throughput.
  }
