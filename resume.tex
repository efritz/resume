\section{work history}

\detailentry
  {Sourcegraph}
  {Staff Software Engineer, Language Platform Team Lead}
  {2019 - Now}
  {Go, TypeScript, Postgres, LLMs}
  {
    Sourcegraph is a fast-growing developer tools company with a mixture of on-prem and SaaS clients for some of the largest technology companies in the world. Among my contributions:
    \\
    $\cdot$ Designed and implemented the Precise Code Intelligence Platform that produces and persists analysis of source code to power features such as cross-repository/global code navigation. More recently, we've integrated this data lake into our AI Coding assistant, Cody, to provide additional context when answering questions about a code base. \\
    $\cdot$ Scaled and optimized our data layer as the resident Postgres expert. Our SaaS database stores 15TB of fresh analysis data at any given point in time, and required the development of new bulk write techniques and novel relational schemas. \\
    $\cdot$ Provided mentorship, project management, and technical guidance for half a dozen engineers as an "Uber Tech Lead". Ownership of infrastructure projects originally written within the Language Platform Team have transitioned to dedicated teams, including executors (which safely invoke untrusted code to produce code analysis results), as well as our database schema migration, schema drift detection, and instance upgrade infrastructure (self-serve upgrades prior to this work would more often than not fail and corrupt data).

\detailentry
  {Mitel}
  {Senior Software Engineer, Labs Team}
  {2015 - 2019}
  {Go, Python, Distributed systems}
  {
    I was the primary designer of \emph{Nighthawk}, an IFTTT-like engine and the surrounding ecosystem to support integration of internal and external services, and \emph{Kestrel}, Mitel's IoT infrastructure and collaboration strategy. Before that, I worked on \emph{Summit}, a CPaaS system that allows users to build voice and SMS applications with Lua code that runs in a containerized sandbox.

\section{education}

\detailentry
  {Ph.D. Engineering, Computer Science}
  {University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee}
  {2018}
  {Milwaukee, WI}
  {
    \emph{`Waddle - Always-Canonical Intermediate Representation'}: an optimizing compiler and a supporting set of algorithms whose internal representation never \emph{goes stale}. Local updates to internal structures reduces compilation time while yielding the same output.
